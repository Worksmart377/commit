# App Title: Commit Planner  (Django + Python fullstack app)
## Intro & Description :
 This is the best handy dandy planner ever! It's meant to assist developers in creating new projects and keeping their tasks organized. You can add tasks and assign them to your projects. You can even search for youtube tutorials in order to implement a feature or correct and error if needed. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it!

### Contribution Guidelines: 
 
 If you would like to contribute to the project you can push your code and create a pull request. Some areas of improvement to focus on would be the sign in feature, the graph iframe, and the youtube iframe. In the future I am looking to add a page for blog posts and a page for NFT's. I also would like to use a different crypto API and the youtube API as well.
